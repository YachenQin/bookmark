# Performance Evaluation proposal #

Because we decided to use Django to do our final creative project. So the database we use is SQLite then we can’t test Mysql. We decided to combined Django with Apache, so we have to test different performance on Apache.

### Experiment one: ###

* Apache web server performance evaluation on different AWS instance types
* We decide to do ApacheBench - load testing:

### Experiment two: ###

* Apache Web Server performance with and without optimizations and tuning
* We decide to configure Apache Content Caching:
